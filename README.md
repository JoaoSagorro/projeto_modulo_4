# RideReady

## Getting Started

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow the steps below:

### 1. Update the Connection Strings

Before running the application, you **must** update the connection strings in the `appSettings` file.  
These connection strings are required for the application to connect to the correct database and services.

- Open the `appSettings.json`.
- Locate the section with the connection strings.
- Replace the placeholders or existing values with your own valid connection strings.

### 2. Run the Application

Once the connection strings have been updated, run the **RideReady** program.
